      <h4>There it is! This is the main page of my first web page.</h4>
      <p>As it is said in my native Latvian&mdash;<span lang="lv">pirmie kucēni jāslīcina</span> (translation&mdash;the first puppies are to be drowned; I know, sounds horrible), so this page most likely will have a lot of errors and mistakes at first that will need quite some fixing.<br>Let's hope it will come out right! :)</p>

        <h5>Learning HTML</h5>
        <p>Learning HTML is easy, but it takes a bit of time and effort.</p>
        <p>First, we should find out, what is HTML.<br>
        Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</blockquote>
        <p>I learn HTML with the help of a Coursera course.</p>
        <aside>
          <p>Coursera is the global online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere access to online courses and degrees from world-class universities and companies.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>To succeed, after learning the theory of HTML one must put an effort to try it in practice.</p>

        <h5>Some elements I have used to practice <code>html</code></h5>
        <p>There are many tags in <code>html</code> that have a semantic meaning and there are some that don't have it and instead of those it is better to use other tags or even CSS.</p>
        <p>So for example, it is not advised to use the tag <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>, but instead - to use CSS for setting the size of a font. But here I am gonna use it anyway to make the word 'small' appear <small>small</small>.</p>
        <p>There is a tag that was used to make text in italics, but is now sometimes used for icons - <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>. Now with HTML5 it is advised to use the tag <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for emphasizing text, for example - I like tea, but I <em>love</em> coffee.</p>
        <p><strong>Attention!</strong> Now some other tags that do have a semantic meaning. I just used - <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> to say that something in the text is important, in this case just one word, but it can be a phrase.</p>
        <p>Now let's try to write something in the opposite dirrection: My name is Dace &equals; <bdo dir="rtl">My name is Dace</bdo></p>
        <p>On <abbr title="Tuesday">Tue</abbr>, September 26 of 1905 at exaclty <time datetime="1905-09-26 09:00">9:00 AM</time> Albert Einstein published a paper about special relativity that is the origin of his theory of relativity and the famous formula E&equals;mc<sup>2</sup>. He got so excited that he had an urgent need to drink some H<sub>2</sub>O, and even splash his face with it. Well, he probably didn't, I made it up just to use a cool tag.</p>
        <p><time datetime="2021-02-02 16:00">Tomorrow</time> I will have a Rimi delivery.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Now.. There's a secret.. Wanna know what it is? :)</summary>
          <p>The browser does some cool stuff when rendering my code.. I didn't even need JS for this.</p>
        </details>
        <p>But for next tags to work I would need JS (and of course some CSS too).</p>
        <p>I am almost done trying out the tags I know. Here's some ways to show, how much I've done:<br>
        A meter bar (most likely, this isn't the right usage for meter):<br>
        <meter max="100" value="90"><label>There is 90% progress of all tags used that Dace knows</label>90%</meter><br>
        And a progress bar. This is the right way to use it:<br>
        <progress value="90" max="100"><label>There is 90% progress of all tags used that Dace knows</label>90%</progress></p>
        <p>Lastly, let's do some damage:
        <button>Send missile to North Correa</button></p>
        <p>Ok, now I'm done!</p>
